# Homework-1-Refactor
# Accessibility

# User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

WHY WAS IT DONE (MOTIVATION; WHAT PROBLEM DID IT SOLVE)?
I completed this project for accessibility purposes. 

WHAT WAS DONE:
HTML Code now follows a semantic structure via use of element tags and comments
Gave all images an alternate description for accessibility purposes
Consolidated CSS Selectors and Properties
